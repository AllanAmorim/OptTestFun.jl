In this work, we present the initial development of a test function package. Its aim is to study the performance of algorithms in the context of Continuous Optimization. This package is implemented in the Julia programming language. Functions, their gradient vectors, and their Hessian matrices are provided.

Seeking to achieve greater flexibility in the use of test functions in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/), we have initiated the development of a test function library in this language. This package, named OptTestFun, provides scalar functions defined in $\mathbb{R}^n$, along with their gradient vectors and Hessian matrices. We are including functions of various natures in the library, such as quadratic functions, functions involving trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic expressions, as well as functions with sums of squares. Some of these functions were chosen from the website [`http://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano`](http://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano).
